# COLOURlovers .NET API

A simple .NET wrapper around the COLOURlovers API.  How simple?  

```C#
var svc = new ColourLoversRepository();
```

Then turn on IntelliSense and ride the lightning.  It's pretty straightforward.  No API keys or anything like that.

## Legalish Stuff

If you would like to use the API in ways outside of this license, contact COLOURlovers here: http://www.colourlovers.com/contact.
